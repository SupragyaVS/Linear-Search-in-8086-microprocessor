# Linear-Search-in-8086-microprocessor
8086 Microprocessor is an enhanced version of 8085 microprocessor that was designed by Intel in 1976.<br /> 
It is a 16-bit µp (short for Microprocessor) having 20 address lines and 16 data lines that provides up to 1MB storage.<br /> 
It consists of powerful instruction set, which provides operations like multiplication and division easily.<br />
This code contains the instruction set to perform a linear search on a given dataset of desired length in rhe memory of an 8086 µp.<br />
